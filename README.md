<p id="description">The "Face Mask Detection System" is an innovative and timely project that leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically detect whether individuals in images or real-time video streams are wearing face masks or not. In the context of the ongoing global pandemic ensuring the proper usage of face masks is crucial for public health and safety. This project addresses this need by providing a reliable and efficient solution for monitoring mask compliance.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Real-time Detection: The system is capable of processing live video streams from sources such as webcams or surveillance cameras in real time. It can identify faces in the frames and determine if a person is wearing a mask.
*   Performance Metrics: The project includes the ability to collect and display performance metrics using matplotlib.
